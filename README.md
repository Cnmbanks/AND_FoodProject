The module can be separated in two main part. The recipe collection section, where the users can start the browsing by selecting a specific food category and so on.

| How to implement a food review module?               | To offer an app for sharing various cookingskills on different food cuisines                                                      | The system will be able to offer an overview over the saved cooking reviews, made by other users.                                    | A logic engine, as well as a dynamic database retrieved into a user-friendly interface                                               | Mojtaba ChrisMartinJonas |
| How can we allow the user to define a food review?   | The user will have the ability to go through the food review by its ingredienciesand cooking method, that is easier to understand | The user will be able to use an editor to add pictures and fill the text fields, which will show the cooking process step by step.   |  Android Studio integration-based interface and database (SQLiteOpen) manipulated by Firebase                                        | Mojtaba ChrisMartinJonas |
| How to make the data secure?                         | The authentication needs to happen in a secure environment                                                                        | The use of hashing ??!                                                                                                               |  Using Firebase?                                                                                                                     | Mojtaba ChrisMartinJonas|
| How to categorize the food reviews?                  | The partakers of the review documentation need to select or add the matched category.                                             | The user will be able to see the different food categories, based on ingrediencies, health level, taste etc.                         | Data querying and data matching algorithms                                                                                           | Mojtaba ChrisMartinJonas |
